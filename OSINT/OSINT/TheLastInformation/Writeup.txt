The Last information
---------------------------------------
Question: Sorry mate this is the only information I could retrieve. I think someone is watching me. I had to take precautions to send this to you. I won't be able to help you anymore regarding the case. Good luck!

1. The photo of the FIR given tells us a story about a waitor's last few minutes before a blast in a bakery.

2. The image also consists of a hidden hint and a reportings database that has the police reportings around that time frame.

3. The hint says that we have to find the mastermind and a date is given 13/02/2010

After we match this data in the excel sheet given we find a name Paras Rimal.
Connecting some dots, the FIR must be a copy of Paras Rimal's statement.
Some research on the internet about bomb blasts near date 13/02/2010 and Paras Rimal tells us that the question is referencing the Pune Bomb blasts of 2010.
All that is left is to find the mastermind of the blasts using some reconnaissance on the Internet.
The mastermind of the blasts was "ILYAS KASHMIRI"

The flag is VishwaCTF{ILYAS_KASHMIRI}
