We are given the question description, 'One of our admins ShrekOP 
is a CSGO esport fan! Do you know about the most expensive 
flashbang in CSGO? Maybe you'll find him there?'

On Googling the same, we get Youtube videos, Reddit posts and news
articles on the topic. On checking the Reddit post and news 
articles, it becomes clear that there is nothing to be found 
there. 

The key is the most viewed video titled 's1mple and the 
Most Expensive Flashbang in the World' (the title of the question
hints to this as well) by theScore esports. Since we are given 
the name to find, we can check the comments with the help of any 
tools available for the same (such as https://ytcomment.kmcat.uk/)
or sorting the comments by newest first, we get the comment by
ShrekOP - 'This is arguably one of the most iconic CSGO clutches 
of all time! I like to play CSGO and watch esports too! Would you
like to know more about me?', a reference to the 'about me' field
of the channel.

On checking it, we get 'My username on (almost) all platforms is 
csgolover_69 and I love CSGO (n̶o̶ ̶s̶h̶i̶t̶ ̶S̶h̶e̶r̶l̶o̶c̶k̶  XD)
Connect with me if you like CSGO and flags!'
The reference to flags reinforces that we are on the correct track.
Also we see that the channel has an uploaded video, with multiple
references to 'steam'.

We check Steam Community for the username "csgolover_69", and find 
a user with the name. On checking the profile, we see that the 
user has uploaded 1 screenshot.

The screenshot is an in-game screengrab from the game CSGO, which
contains the mirrored flag on the right wall.
