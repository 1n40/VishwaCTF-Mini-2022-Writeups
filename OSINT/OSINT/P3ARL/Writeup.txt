Question:Until recently, the location of executed wartime Japanese Prime 
Minister Hideki Tojo's remains was one of World War II's biggest
mysteries in the nation he once led. 
Now, a Japanese university professor has revealed declassified U.S.
military documents that appear to hold the answer.

After searching up the story of Hideki Tojo, you will come across a document.
The documents show the cremated ashes of Tojo, one of the masterminds of the Pearl Harbor attack, 
were scattered from a U.S. Army aircraft over the Pacific Ocean about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east
of Yokohama, Japan's second-largest city, south of Tokyo.
