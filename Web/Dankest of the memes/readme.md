Solution: This is a generic php challenge.
The solution is simple.
You can see 3 conditional statements.
First, says that the your string length should be 5 or less
Second, it should be more than 90000 but less than 99999.
From these conditions you can understand that if you pass the number variable and follow the above conditions, you will get the flag out of the site
In my case i did the following
https://miniques3.herokuapp.com/?number=99997
And it gave me the flag.
