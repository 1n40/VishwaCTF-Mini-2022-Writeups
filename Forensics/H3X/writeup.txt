Question:Why does everyone keep sending me corrupt data?

Here we are a given an image but its not opening.So we open check whether 
the file type really and image or not
By opening the file in Hexedit we see that it really is an image but 
the signature format of header has been changed.
In order to recover it we edit the header to the actual signature of jpeg,

By doing this we see that now the image is accessible and the flag is
{TH1S_1S_H0W_W3_R0LL}
