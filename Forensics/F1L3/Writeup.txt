Question:I have come across a text file but it seems to contain random letters and symbols.
Can you find the flag?
Hint: If you are having trouble with this bit,try shifting your focus.

Hola and welcome to the forensics challenge.This is just filler text to make it longer.

In this challenge we are given a text file with random data.
The file is definitely a text file. 
However we can’t make any sense of it looking at it in a text editor.
We need to use a hex editor to look for more clues.

The hint states “If you are having trouble with this bit,try shifting your focus.” 
Bit-Shifting involves shifting every bit in the file. 
We can do this with a hex editor called WinHex.
By shifting the bits to the right once, the file is displayed normally.
