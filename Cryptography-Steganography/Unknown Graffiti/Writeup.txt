Problem Name: UNKNOWN GRAFFITI
Author: Jayesh Bhave
Flag: vishwaCTF{UNOWN_HYPNOTIC}
Problem: 
	My Friend visited an ancient cave and found some old graffiti on wall of Cave.
	It seemed Interesting so he sent it to me to find what that means. But this is not familiar to me.
	And also he said - "Here are so many Unknowns in Cave."

Solution:

Step 1: Just like Pikalang which is language of Pikachu there's a Language of Unown which is species of Pokemon having unknown shape.
Using this Unown Language Flag is encrypted.
Step 2: Decrypt it using Unown Lang Decoder to get the Final Flag and separate to words using UnderScore.
Step 3: Also there's a way to solve this without decoder, as we can see the shape of every element in image, they have shape of an Alphabet.
Using that Logic we can find out Flag
Step 4: On Decoding the String in Image we get Flag as :- vishwaCTF{UNOWN_HYPNOTIC}
