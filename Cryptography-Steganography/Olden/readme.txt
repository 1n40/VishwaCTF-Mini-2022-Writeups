Once a detective was walking down the street when he found a note addressed to him. It read the following.
he took out his standard 12 key phone and dialled his friend to help him solve the puzzle.suddenly from the other end a voice was heard "stop playing with the lazy susan and hand me the vineger, BEAUFORT." "Pardon me?","Oh no no,i was talking to my son.I don't know whats gotten into him today. Sorry about that detective! what were you saying again?" To this the detective replied," Don't worry I figured it out"
Can you find out what the detective figured out on his own?
