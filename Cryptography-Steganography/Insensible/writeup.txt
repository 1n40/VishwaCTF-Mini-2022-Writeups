Problem : 
Insensible

Only insensisble people will be able to make sense or is it the other way around? IDK it took away my sense and time.

P.S. -- Seperate the words by underscore( _ )

Solution : 

Step 1 :
Read the problem statement carefully to pick out the following hints from it
1. "or is it the other way around"
2. "took away my sense and time"

Then carefully observe the given ciphertext to note that every alternate word is a measure of time spelled in reverse order. [2nd word : DECADES, 4th word : TIME, 6th word : YEARS, 8th word : SECONDS, 10th word : CENTURIES, 12th word : MINUTES, 14th word : MILLENIA, 16th word : HOURS]

Step 2 :
Remove all the time references to get the flag in ciphertext :
Ciphertext : SARC UWDR CEEY HINP TMOM IEDA OTTK NHOE

Observe that each word is exactly 4 alphabets long and total number of words are 8 which is also a multiple of 4.
Such a symmetry is observed mostly is matrices and columnar transposition ciphers.
Arrange the words in a grid of 4 x 4 as each word is 4 characters long and total length of ciphertext is also multiple of 4

On doing this we get 2 grids as follows :
S	A	R	C	  	T	M	 O	M  
U	W	D	R		I	E	D	A
C	E	E	Y		O	T	T	K
H	I	N	P		N	H	O	E


as per the Columnar transposition method, we read them vertically to find the following string
flag = SUCHAWEIRDENCRYPTIONMETHODTOMAKE

And as given in the question we seperate the words with a underscore( _ )
flag = SUCH_A_WEIRD_ENCRYPTION_METHOD_TO_MAKE

we then wrap it in flag format to get the final flag for submission as
flag = vishwaCTF{SUCH_A_WEIRD_ENCRYPTION_METHOD_TO_MAKE}
